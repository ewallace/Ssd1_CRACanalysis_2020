# Summary

We are looking for occurences of the major part of the Ssd1-binding motif, `CNYTCNYT`, in *Aspergillus fumigatus*.

Here we downloaded the 1000nt of genomic sequence upstream of translation start codons from [fungidb](https://fungidb.org/).

The major finding is that this motif is comparatively rare in *A. fumigatus* upstream sequences, and genes with the motif are enriched in cell wall proteins. This is what we expected.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
theme_set(theme_cowplot(font_size = 12))

library(Biostrings)
```


# Load approximate 1000nt UTRs

```{r load_upstream1000}
# define fasta filename
Af_up1000_file <- paste(here::here(), 
                        "motif_conservation",
                        "data", 
                        "Afumigatus_Af293_ATG_upstream_1000nt.fasta",
                        sep= "/")

# load fasta file as DNA string set
Af_up1000_DSS <- readDNAStringSet(Af_up1000_file)

# remove truncated sequences, which we don't need.
Af_up1000_DSS <- Af_up1000_DSS[width(Af_up1000_DSS) == 1000]

# assign just the ORF id to the name, but keep all the info. 
Af_namesinfo <- 
    tibble(everything = names(Af_up1000_DSS)) %>%
    tidyr::separate(everything,into = c("id","strain","info","seqtype","seq","length"), sep = " \\| ") %>%
    dplyr::select(id, info,seq)

names(Af_up1000_DSS) <- Af_namesinfo$id

# print the DNA string set to check it came out ok
Af_up1000_DSS
```


# Count occurences of Ssd1 motif CNYTCNYT

We use functions from Biostrings (bioconductor) to find motif instances. 
This was inspired by [a blogpost from kasper daniel hansen](https://kasperdanielhansen.github.io/genbioconductor/html/Biostrings_Matching.html).

We use `fixed = "subject"` to allow ambiguous characters in the pattern `CNYTCNYT`, but not in the sequence being searched.

We put all the relevant counts into a tibble for easier post-processing.

```{r CNYTCNYT_count}
CNYTCNYT_count_df <- tibble(id = Af_namesinfo$id,
                            info = Af_namesinfo$info,
                            count_up1000 = vcountPattern(pattern = DNAString("CNYTCNYT"),
                                 subject = Af_up1000_DSS,
                                 fixed = "subject"),
                            count_up200 = vcountPattern(pattern = DNAString("CNYTCNYT"),
                                 subject = subseq(Af_up1000_DSS,start = 801L, end = 1000L),
                                 fixed = "subject"),
                            count_up100 = vcountPattern(pattern = DNAString("CNYTCNYT"),
                                 subject = subseq(Af_up1000_DSS,start = 901L, end = 1000L),
                                 fixed = "subject")
)

summary(CNYTCNYT_count_df)
```

## Which genes have highest counts?

```{r high_counts, results="asis"}
arrange(CNYTCNYT_count_df,desc(count_up100)) %>%
    head(n = 20) %>%
    knitr::kable()
```


## 1000nt upstream

Results from all 1000nt upstream.

```{r CNYTCNYT_ctdist_up1000,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5}
CNYT_up1000_reducedmean <- CNYTCNYT_count_df %>%
    pull(count_up1000) %>%
    mean()

CNYT_up1000_reducedvar <- CNYTCNYT_count_df %>%
    pull(count_up1000) %>%
    var()

ggplot(data = CNYTCNYT_count_df, aes(x = count_up1000)) +
    geom_bar(width = 1, aes(y = ..prop..), stat = "count", group = 1) +
    geom_line(data = tibble(),
              aes(x = 0:20, y = dpois(0:20,lambda=CNYT_up1000_reducedmean)),
              colour = "blue") + 
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.5,16), oob = scales::squish)
```

This count is overdispersed relative to a Poisson distribution, with mean `r CNYT_up1000_reducedmean`, variance `r CNYT_up1000_reducedvar`.

## 100nt upstream

Results filtered to only the 100nt closest to the start codon.

```{r CNYTCNYT_ctdist_up100,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5}
CNYT_up100_reducedmean <- CNYTCNYT_count_df %>%
    pull(count_up100) %>%
    mean()

CNYT_up100_reducedvar <- CNYTCNYT_count_df %>%
    pull(count_up100) %>%
    var()

ggplot(data = CNYTCNYT_count_df, aes(x = count_up100)) +
    geom_bar(width = 1, aes(y = ..prop..), stat = "count", group = 1) +
    geom_line(data = tibble(),
              aes(x = 0:20, y = dpois(0:20,lambda=CNYT_up100_reducedmean)),
              colour = "blue") + 
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.5,16), oob = scales::squish)
```

This count is slightly overdispersed relative to a Poisson distribution, with mean `r CNYT_up100_reducedmean`, variance `r CNYT_up100_reducedvar`.

# Write list of genes for GO search, based on counts 100nt upstream

```{r gene_list_output}

id_file_CNYTCNYT1_up100 <- paste(here::here(),
                                 "motif_conservation",
                                 "results",
                                 "Af_id_list_CNYTCNYT1_up100.txt",
                                 sep = "/")

CNYTCNYT_count_df %>%
    filter(count_up100 >= 1) %>%
    pull(id) %>%
    write_lines(file = id_file_CNYTCNYT1_up100)

id_file_CNYTCNYT2_up100 <- paste(here::here(),
                                 "motif_conservation",
                                 "results",
                                 "Af_id_list_CNYTCNYT2_up100.txt",
                                 sep = "/")

CNYTCNYT_count_df %>%
    filter(count_up100 >= 2) %>%
    pull(id) %>%
    write_lines(file = id_file_CNYTCNYT2_up100)
```

Next, I did a GO term search of these genelists on [AspGD](http://http://www.aspergillusgenome.org//).
Using their [GO Term Finder](http://www.aspergillusgenome.org/cgi-bin/GO/goTermFinder)

That found significantly enriched GO terms including cell wall (component) in genes with at least 2x CNYTCNYT motifs in the 100nt upstream, file `Af_id_list_CNYTCNYT2_up100.txt`. Results are saved in the file `Af_goFinderResult_11373_component_AspGD_id_list_CNYTCNYT2_up100.txt`.
